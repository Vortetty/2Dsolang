# 2Dsolang

all code takes place on a 2d grid (included interpreter supports 32x32 code and 32 bytes of memory), any character that isn't defined as a command is treated as a noop unless part of a command
code starts at the top left corner of the grid, by default it will execute left to right
if it hits the end it wraps
